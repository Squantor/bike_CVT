# Bicycle Continuous Variable Transmission mechanical test jig
To start development of control algorithms and characterising the system a test jig is first made consisting of two stepper motors driving a planetary gear set and a threephase stepper motor as a variable load. This test jig consists of a few freecad design files.
* NEMA motor mount is a parametric design for a NEMA sized motor mount that will hold the three motors.
* ring gear bearing mount is a parametric design that attaches to a motor mount and holds the bearing for the ring gear

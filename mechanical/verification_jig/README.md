# Bicycle Continuous Variable Transmission mechanical test jig
To start development of control algorithms and characterising the system a test jig is first made consisting of two stepper motors driving a planetary gear set and a threephase stepper motor as a variable load. This test jig consists of a few freecad design files.
* NEMA motor mount is a parametric motor mount that will hold the three motors.

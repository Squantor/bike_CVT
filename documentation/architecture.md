The mechanical system is similar on how a toyota prius hybrid system ensures that the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) keeps a steady RPM while the speed of the car varies. In the bike CVT's case the rider plays the role of the engine and the CVT system ensures a steady riding cadence and riding power.
